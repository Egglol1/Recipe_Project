## Reflection Questions

1. Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.

Django models are python classes that Django creates SQL tables with. The attributes of the class give Django the idea for what to assign as columns, and what specific data can go within them. These models are far easier to write than every individual query in SQL or SQLite, which allows developers to work more quickly with a language they already understand.

2. In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example project to explain your answer.

Projects can bloat and become very large in scope over thr course fo their development. If one does not begin writing tests at the start of a project, their eventual workload will continue to build up until they must spend weeks just working on writing tests for their project.
